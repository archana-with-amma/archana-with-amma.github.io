Memorize the names of Devi and Mata Amritanandamayi!

This is an app that will test you on what you already know and show you your mistakes. 

To develop: bower install to get local packages. I use coffeescript and python's simplehttpserver.

The commands you can run to start working are 

coffee -bcw .
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

I'm planning on adding tests soon using karma and organizing the code in differently as the project gets more complicated.
